# 📊 Titanic EDA – Task 5 (Data Analyst Internship)

This repository contains my submission for **Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** as part of the Data Analyst Internship. The goal is to analyze the Titanic dataset and extract meaningful insights using Python.

---

## 🗂️ Files Included

- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete EDA
- `train.csv` – Titanic dataset used for analysis
- `EDA_Report.pdf` – Exported PDF report with visuals and observations
- `README.md` – Overview and documentation

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Gender Impact:** Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- **Class Impact:** 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
- **Age Factor:** Younger passengers had a higher survival rate.
- **Fare Correlation:** Passengers who paid higher fares (often 1st class) had better survival odds.
- **Missing Data:** Notable missing values in `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`. `Cabin` has the most missing values.

## 📊 Visualizations Performed

- Countplots (Survival by gender and class)
- Histogram (Age distribution)
- Boxplot (Age vs. Pclass)
- Heatmap (Feature correlation)
- Pairplot (Numeric features vs. Survival)

---

## 📚 Concepts Demonstrated

- Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis
- Handling Missing Values
- Feature Distributions and Relationships
- Correlation Analysis using `.corr()` and Heatmaps
